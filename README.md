## 🏗️ Architecture: Clean Architecture
This project follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, ensuring scalability, testability, and maintainability. The architecture is modularized within a **monorepo** structure using [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/).

---

## 🌍 Localization
Localization support is integrated for multiple languages. Currently, the default is set to **English (en)**, but the architecture is extensible for additional locales.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables
Environment configuration is handled securely using **dotenv**. Simply create a `.env` file in the root directory with your environment-specific variables.
